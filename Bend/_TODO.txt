--------[ TODO ]---------

- setup git server and laptop build

*** row attributes for MVCC and locks
(a) introduce row-attribute concept (can affect commit, row visibility, etc.)
(b) attach MVCC attribute handler to writes, attach txn id to each row
(c) txn-id and MVCC attribute can transparently 'fall off' a row if txn commits, 


- cleaner way to handle code and encoding of stored data, such as block pointers, freelist.. (binstruct?)
- 'real' freelist handling

- incremental merge (small step, eventually does a full merge)
- age-out tombstones when in oldest generation (remember oldest gen #?)


--------[ Bigger TODO items ]-----------



*** First Automated Replication
(a) 'lock' for old generations (i.e. checkpoint),
(b) copy locked data to replica
(c) create new 'lock' for newer data, goto (b), until we are up-to-date

*** try using C# sqlite sql implementation to throw SQL on top
